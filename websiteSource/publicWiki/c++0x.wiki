== Introduction of Lambda in c++0x: ==

Lambda can be used like this,


{{{class="brush: cpp"

#include <iostream>

	using  namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		int i = 1024;
		auto func = [=] { printf("%d\n", i); };
		func();

		return 0;
	}

}}}

and in `[]` there are some options,


{{{class="brush: cpp"

    []        Capture nothing (or, a scorched earth strategy?)
	[&]       Capture any referenced variable by reference
	[=]       Capture any referenced variable by making a copy
	[=, &foo] Capture any referenced variable by making a copy, but capture variable foo by reference
	[bar]     Capture bar by making a copy; don't copy anything else
	[this]    Capture the this pointer of the enclosing class

}}}

it also can involve param, like this,


{{{class="brush: cpp"

    #inlcude <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	int main()
	{
		auto func=[](int x, int y){ cout << x+y << endl;};
		func( 2, 6);
		return 0;
	}

}}}
the result is 8, what a wonderful feature of c++..

It will become very very useful in STL, especially in the function of for_each(iter_begin,iter_end,[]{balabala;});

So that's it. The Lambda.
