# the relationship between `threads`, `block` and `SM( Streaming Multiprocessors`
  - `threads` and `block`: each block contains many `threads`, `threads` in same block executes same instruction, and they share data and need to synchronize.
  - `block` and `SM`: `SM` is a set of `block` and it uses `wrap` to schedule unit in `SM`. Each `SM` have up to a constant `blocks`. e.g. `G80` each `SM` have up to 8 `Blocks`, and each `warp` can manage up to 32 `threads`.

# definition of `kernel`
  - A function that executes on the device is typically called a `kernel`
Ralated information

# `<<< m , n >>>`
  - `m` represents the number of parallel blocks in which we would like the device to execute our kernel

# `gridDim`
  - This variable is a constant across all blocks and simply holds the dimensions of the grid that was launched. It is the number of blocks.
# `blockDim`
  - It stored the number of blocks along each dimension of the entire grid
