=== Task after class ===

- [ ] Reviewing Discrete Math
- [ ] Learning Python

=== Unresolve Question ===

- [X] In Python, A[3:5] means A{3,4,5} or A{2,3,4}
	* So in Python, the index i is the before cursor of element, so A[a,b} means form a to b, not including the element before index b.
	* In _Learning Python_ , it says as follows,
		- S[1:3] fetches from offsets 1 up to, but not including, 3
		- S[1:] fetches from offsets 1 through the end (length)
		- S[:-1] fetches from offsets 0 up to, but not including, the last item

- [ ] If the complexity of an Algorithm is O(n^2^), so it's also in O(n^3^), So why do not we use \theta to refer to the complexity.
