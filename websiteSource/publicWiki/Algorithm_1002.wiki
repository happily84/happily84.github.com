= Perparation to the Entrance Exam of Algorithm =

== Discrete Math: == 
- [X] asymptotic notation
- [] [[basic summation formulas]]
- [] [[sets(operations on sets, relations, functions)]]
- [] counting (permutations, sets, combinations, binomial coefficients)

== Basic Data Structures ==
- [] array
- [] list
- [] queue
- [] stack
- [] binary search trees
- [] balanced binary search trees
- [] heap

== Sorting and Searching ==
- [] quicksort
- [] mergesort
- [] heapsort
- [] [[radix-sort]]
- [] binary search

== Graph algorithms ==
- [] DFS
- [] BFS
- [] [[connected components]]
- [] [[biconnected components]]

== Digraph algorithms ==
- [] DFS
- [] BFS
- [] [[strongly connected components]]
- [] [[transitive closure]]
- [] [[topological sorting]]

== note ==
* what the different between array and list.
  - List including `Linked list` and `array list`
  - the most different between list and array is that array is fixed size, and list is dynamic
* read chapter 10, 11, 12, 22, 23
