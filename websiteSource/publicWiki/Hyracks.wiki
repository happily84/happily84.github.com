== What is Hyracks ==

In my opinion, Hyracks is a paralle platform to serve as a target for compiling higher-level declarative data-processing languages. The motivation of Hyracks is that some companies use `Hadoop` as their paralle platform, but `Hadoop` has some limitations likes it requires fairly sophisticated skills to translate end-user's problem into jobs in `Hadoop`. So many companies develop their own high-level language under `Hadoop`. However, if we build a new paralle platform from the start, it would be more efficent. That is why we develop `Hyracks`.

== Why Hyracks ==

# Hyracks already includes a build-in collection of operators that can be use to assemble data processing jobs without writing processing logic akin to Map and Reduce code.
# Hyracks has a rich API in order to enable better planning and runtime scheduling for jobs.
# Hadoop compatibility.
# Performance better than Hadoop.
# Good fault recovery.
# Open-source.
