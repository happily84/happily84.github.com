= transitive closure =

Definition: The definition in mathematics is so complicated. In my view, if xRy and yRz can induct to xRz, then we can say that there exists a transitive closure between x and z.

Another example in wikipedia: For example, if X is a set of airports and x R y means "there is a direct flight from airport x to airport y", then the transitive closure of R on X is the relation R^+^: "it is possible to fly from x to y in one or more flights."
