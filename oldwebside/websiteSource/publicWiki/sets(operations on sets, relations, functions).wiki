= Set( operation, relations, functions) =

== Relations ==

# Definition: AXB={(a,b): a is a member of A && b is a member of B} and ARB ={(a,b: a is a member of A && b is a member of B && aRb}.

== Operation ==

# No Definition
# Basic Operation includes:
  - Union
  - Intersection
  - Complements
  - Cartesian product

== Functions ==

# Definition: if there exists a Relation AXB in A and B, and for each a in A, there exists and only exists one element in B. This relations can be called a function.
